RE3 Classic Rebirth 3 TeamX HD Mod Loader

This mod allows "hires" texture assets and "zmovie" cutscenes to load exclusively from the mod_hd folder.

CR3 loads MP4 movies by default, so any correctly named MP4 files in mod_hd/zmovie/ (e.g. snl.mp4) will also be loaded.

This solution ensures the HD Mod is only active when this specific mod is selected, allowing users to switch between HD and Vanilla experiences easily without file conflicts.

Requires: TeamX dinput8.dll, libwebp.dll, and bio3hd.asi and a "hires" (Team X/Seamless HD) texture pack folder.

Special Thanks:

- Gemini: for his amazing work on Classic Rebirth 3 and Mod SDK which I used to develop this mod.
- TeamX: for their incredible HD mod loader/dumper.
- The Seamless HD guys, who made my preffered go-to original looking HD mod pack for TeamX mod.
